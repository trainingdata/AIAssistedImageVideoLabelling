Deep learning requires millions of images as input. Task of labeling millions of images requires many individuals. These individuals might be freelancers, and they might be located in distant locations. A data-science team needs to engage freelance workforce to complete their tasks. The Collaborator feature allows data-science team to invite individuals to help with a labeling project. If multiple users are collaborating on an annotating project, TrainingData.io application distributes all of the data attached to a project to the collaborators with access. Collaborators will only get unique data, meaning there will not be multiple annotators annotating the same data. Roles Annotator The Annotator role can annotate queued data and view their own work from the Activity Table. An annotator cannot view annotators performance or view/modify any aspect of the project configuration or data sources. Reviewer The Reviewer role extends the annotator role by being able to see and review all annotated data in the project. Admin The Admin role can add and edit projects, data and Annotators. By default, the user that signs up for an account has the role of Admin. Project Based Roles When a user is given a project based role, they don't have access to projects by default. However, the user is granted access to each project with a specific role and the role of each project can be changed. The benefit of this is that you can limit the access and the role of a user depending on the project at your discretion.","title":"Collaborators"},{"location":"v1.0/Collaborators/Collaborators/#collaborators","text":"","title":"Collaborators"},{"location":"v1.0/Collaborators/Collaborators/#why-do-you-need-collaborators","text":"Deep learning requires millions of images as input.

In order to give labeling task to freelance annotators, data science team needs to define specifications of a labeling task. Those specifications need to be converted to a user-experience.

Objects can have properties like color, size, shape etc. Data-scientist wants to present these properties in question-and-answer HTML form to the annotator. Labeling instruction has two parts to it. Left panel and right panel. The left panel shows list of classes, their attributes and image-attributes. The right-panel shows how annotation-user-experience appear to the annotator (exactly). How to create a new Labeling Instruction? As you add a class or an attribute on left panel, you will observe same class and attributes will show up on the right panel in real time. Step 1: Creating First Class-Type Classes are abstract-representation of real world objects that machine learning model learns about. Each class can have a: Name: Associated real world object-class (like a car) Color Tool to be used to draw each object-instance belonging to that class Sub-attributes are the properties of that class type Step 2: Adding Attributes to Class-Type Attributes define properties of real world objects. A simple example is color of car is a property of that car. Data scientists would want to know these properties, so that they can use it to train machines that make decision. An attribute is a question that you ask an annotator. There are four different data-types of an attribute: Text: alphanumeric data entry Multi-select Checkbox: a list of check boxes with multi-select functionality Single-select Drop down list: with single select functionality Single-select Radio button: with single selection functionality Step 3: Final Labeling Interface After adding all classes and attributes to a labelling interface, a complete labelling interface will look like this:","title":"Labeling Instruction Builder"},{"location":"v1.0/Labelling Interface/Builder/#labeling-instruction-builder","text":"","title":"Labeling Instruction Builder"},{"location":"v1.0/Labelling Interface/Builder/#what-is-a-labeling-instruction","text":"In order to give labeling task to freelance annotators, data science team needs to define specifications of a labeling task.

It also empowers AI-teams with data-collaboration. How do I start using your annotation tool? Login to app.trainingdata.io How do I create a labeling job for annotators? Once you have created a TrainingData.io account use the instructions here to create a labeling job. Why should I not build home-grown labeling solution? When building home-grown data labeling infrastructure, consider the following: Total Cost of Ownership : Homegrown tools are built to exist and serve a particular function, but with new business, demands come to the cost of upgrades. There is a high cost of ongoing maintenance, both in time and money. Technical debt accrues over time due to engineer turn-over, product neglect, and evolving product demands. Unknown and Evolving Scope : Developing an internal product requires planning, resource allocation, and preparing for the unknown. Because feature flagging platforms are relatively new, it can be difficult to accurately define the scope and construct a solution for needs across engineering and product groups. Minimum Viable Functionality : Internal tools are generally not built for usability, scalability, or cross-team support. They are built to solve an immediate pain point or provide minimum viable functionality as quickly as possible. Data Labeling is Cross Functional : Turning raw data into accurate and consistent training data is a team effort. Engineers, domain experts (annotators), and managers must work together while playing different roles. Data annotation infrastructure must facilitate this by providing information and interfaces unique to these roles. Enterprise Readiness : Productizing AI systems takes fast, reliable, and scaled infrastructure across raw data collection, data labeling, and compute. Pricing Questions How much does TrainingData.io cost? For organizations building enterprise grade AI systems, we offer Enterprise pricing model. For small businesses and startups we offer Pro license. We offer free trial for developers and data-scientists who want to try our product with a limitation of 2500 labels per year. Free trial does not include on-premises installation of the labeling tool. Do you offer discount for research organizations? For organizations building non-commercial, or not-for-profit research, we offer discounted or free license. Please reach us at info@trainingdata.io Other Questions What is Data annotation? In order to train machines to make decisions on behalf of humans, they must learn to make those decisions. In order to learn about the world around us, machines take input in form of images and text that is labeled for representative features. A label in an image is clearly marked bounding region that represents a real world entity or object. Managing data labeling at very large scale is time consuming and requires special software. What kind of data can I annotate with TrainingData.io application? With our labeling solution you can label any visual dataset including images and videos. We natively support medical imaging format - DICOM. What kind of data formats are supported by TrainingData.io? Our annotation tools support JPEG, PNG, DICOM (natively), NIFTI (natively), MOV (H.264, H.265, VP8/9 natively), MP4 (H.264, H.265, VP8/9 natively), TAR, ZIP, GZ, CSV How Trainingdata.io application will help my data science team deploy Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence? Trainingdata.io is a place where you can start small and scale-up your data management operations with time. We help you manage early-stage AI projects with internal stakeholders. Once your are ready to scale operations we connect you with human-labelers outside your organization. We help you control quality of work produced by third-party human labelers. This helps you improve quality of your machine learning models at fast pace and at fraction of cost. How is Trainingdata.io different from managed labeling services? Managed Labeling services produce error rates as high as 35%. This is due to low quality and inconsistency of labeling tools. Quality of labels produced by workforce depends on quality of user experience for the human labelers. We empower data science team to control user-experience of human labelers. What sets us apart is our focus on: Pixel accurate annotation tools Customizable labeling instruction for every task Quality and performance management system (QMS) Data security and privacy protection with on-premises solution using Docker. Compare the two workflows in image below: Old (current) Work Flow New Work Flow Does Trainingdata.io provide support? Trainingdata.io provides support to all users. Does TrainingData.io have a discount for academic users? Yes, we do if your research is non-commercial. Please reach us at info@trainingdata.io I have my data annotated by a service. Why would I use TrainingData.io? With TrainingData.io you can still outsource your annotating projects as well as leverage your internal team on those same projects. The big differentiator is that with TrainingData.io you can manage the quality and performance of your entire annotating team whether they are outsourced or internal, all in one place. TrainingData.io does not provide in-house annotating services but we do work with several annotating companies (BPO Firms) that we have vetted and currently work with many of our customers in TrainingData.io. We simply recommend them as a third party to help our customers so you are always free to choose any annotating services company that meets your requirements. My company hacked a open-source tool that seems to work okay. Why would I use TrainingData.io? It's quick and easy to start annotating data using locally installed tools. For most simple annotation tasks being performed by a single annotator, this solution architecture annotates well. As data annotation needs scale, data management and quality control processes are needed to produce accurate and consistent training data. A common cause of under performing AI systems is low accuracy training data. Will TrainingData.io improve the quality and consistency of my labeled data? This is one of our core competencies and one of the main reasons we decided to build TrainingData.io application. We saw that all the available options for annotating made it extremely difficult to ensure our training data was high enough in quality for a production-ready machine learning model and it cost us valuable time and money in the end. We developed a world-class quality and performance management interface within our platform to address this. Annotation Questions How do I setup a project? You can set up a project in three steps: Click \u201cAdd Project\u201d and give the project a name. Attach your data set to the project. Customize your labeling interface. Start Labeling! Does TrainingData.io work with Cloud buckets data such as Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage? Check out our guide for Connecting Cloud Data. How do I revisit skipped or submitted labels? You can do this by Re-Enqueuing them from the Activity Tab. For a guide on Re-Enqueuing labels click here Does TrainingData.io work with on-premises data? TrainingData.io works with source data hosted on-premises or on a private cloud. The source data is accessed directly from the client computer and never shared (or accessible) by TrainingData.io. Check out our guide here. Does TrainingData.io work on mobile devices? We do not currently support mobile devices, although we are working on adding this in the future. Can I annotate on an iPad? Yes . Does Trainingdata.io work in all countries? Yes, unless your network has a restrictive firewall, or you have internet connectivity issues. We currently only support the English language on our platform. Does Trainingdata.io application work without an internet connection? No, you must have an internet connection to use TrainingData.io application. What browser do you recommend for TrainingData.io application? We recommend Chrome. We do not recommend Internet Explorer or Safari due to compatibility issues. What formats can I export my annotated data? Your annotated data can be exported in JSON, Mask and PNG which should allow you to import it into any machine learning framework. How does Auto Consensus work? Auto Consensus ensures consistency and accuracy of the labeled data. When turned on, some or all of the images are labeled by more than one labeler so that a consensus among labelers for each labeled datum can be calculated and ultimately managed. You can configure the percentage of your dataset in a project that will be randomly selected to be labeled more than once by distinct collaborators. You can also configure the number of times this percentage of labels will be labeled. Check out our docs here for more detail. Will other labelers see the same data that I'm labeling? If Auto Consensus is turned on and configured then yes, otherwise no. Does TrainingData.io have an API? Yes, we have a fully featured API. Everything you can do with our interface, you can do programmatically through our API. The API is available on our Enterprise tier. You may contact sales at https://trainingdata.io/contact. If you are a paid user you may request an API key from our support team via the Chat icon (preferred method) or by sending an email to info@trainingdata.io, and title it \"API Request\".* I already have training data. Can I import it into Trainingdata.io application? Yes, it can be imported. Simply send us the annotated data and we will reformat it and upload it for you. How do I delete a project?

Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy. By using or accessing the Services in any manner, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, and you hereby consent that we will collect, use, and share your information in the following ways. Remember that your use of TrainingData\u2019s Services is at all times subject to the Terms of Use, which incorporates this Privacy Policy. Any terms we use in this Policy without defining them have the definitions given to them in the Terms of Use. What does this Privacy Policy cover? This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information (\"Personal Information\") that we gather when you are accessing or using our Services, but not to the practices of companies we don\u2019t own or control, or people that we don\u2019t manage. We gather various types of Personal Information from our users, as explained in more detail below, and we use this Personal Information internally in connection with our Services, including to personalize, provide, and improve our services, to allow you to set up a user account and profile, to contact you and allow other users to contact you, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, and to analyze how you use the Services. In certain cases, we may also share some Personal Information with third parties, but only as described below. As noted in the Terms of Use, we do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any personal information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us personal information, please contact us at support@TrainingData.io Will TrainingData ever change this Privacy Policy? We\u2019re constantly trying to improve our Services, so we may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to time as well, but we will alert you to changes by placing a notice on the Services, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means. Please note that if you\u2019ve opted not to receive legal notice emails from us (or you haven\u2019t provided us with your email address), those legal notices will still govern your use of the Services, and you are still responsible for reading and understanding them. If you use the Services after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of the changes. What Information does TrainingData Collect? Information You Provide to Us: We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us. For example, through the registration process and/or through your account settings, we may collect Personal Information such as your name, email address, phone number, and third-party account credentials (for example, your log-in credentials for Facebook or other third party sites). If you provide your third-party account credentials to us or otherwise sign in to the Services through a third party site or service, you understand some content and/or information in those accounts (\u201cThird Party Account Information\u201d) may be transmitted into your account with us if you authorize such transmissions], and that Third Party Account Information transmitted to our Services is covered by this Privacy Policy; for example, your public profile information from Facebook. Certain information may be required to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features. We may communicate with you if you\u2019ve provided us the means to do so. For example, if you\u2019ve given us your email address, we may send you promotional email offers on behalf of other businesses, or email you about your use of the Services. Also, we may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. This confirmation helps us make our communications with you more interesting and improve our services. If you do not want to receive communications from us, please indicate your preference by emailing us at support@TrainingData.io. Information Collected Automatically Whenever you interact with our Services, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser or device, which may include your IP address, geolocation data, device identification, \u201ccookie\u201d information, the type of browser and/or device you\u2019re using to access our Services, and the page or feature you requested. \u201cCookies\u201d are identifiers we transfer to your browser or device that allow us to recognize your browser or device and tell us how and when pages and features in our Services are visited and by how many people. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your device\u2019s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features. Our advertising partners may also transmit cookies to your browser or device, when you click on ads that appear on the Services. Also, if you click on a link to a third party website or service, such third party may also transmit cookies to you. Again, this Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties, and we aren\u2019t responsible for their privacy policies and practices. Please be aware that cookies placed by third parties may continue to track your activities online even after you have left our Services, and those third parties may not honor \u201cDo Not Track\u201d requests you have set using your browser or device. We may use this data to customize content for you that we think you might like, based on your usage patterns. We may also use it to improve the Services - for example, this data can tell us how often users use a particular feature of the Services, and we can use that knowledge to make the Services interesting to as many users as possible. Information Collected From Other Websites and Do Not Track Policy Through cookies we place on your browser or device, we may collect information about your online activity after you leave our Services. Just like any other usage information we collect, this information allows us to improve the Services and customize your online experience, and otherwise as described in this Privacy Policy. Your browser may offer you a \u201cDo Not Track\u201d option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites. Our Services do not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means that we collect information about your online activity both while you are using the Services and after you leave our Services. Will TrainingData Share Any of the Personal Information it Receives? We may share your Personal Information with third parties as described in this below: Information that\u2019s been de-identified. We may de-identify your Personal Information so that you are not identified as an individual, and provide that information to our partners. We may also provide aggregate usage information to our partners (or allow partners to collect that information from you), who may use such information to understand how often and in what ways people use our Services, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal online experience. However, we never disclose aggregate usage or de-identified information to a partner (or allow a partner to collect such information) in a manner that would identify you as an individual. Analytics: We may use third party analytics services, such as Google Analytics, to grow our business, to improve and develop our Services, to monitor and analyze use of our Services, to aid our technical administration, to increase the functionality and user-friendliness of our Services, and to verify that users have the authorization needed for us to process their requests. These services may collect and retain some information about you. Google Analytics collects the IP address assigned to you on the date you use the Services, but not your name or other personally identifying information. We do not combine the information generated through the use of Google Analytics with your Personal Information. Although Google Analytics plants a persistent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you use the Services, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google\u2019s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your use of the Services is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy. You may find additional information about Google Analytics at www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/. Finally, you can opt out of Google Analytics by visiting https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/. Advertisers: We allow advertisers and/or merchant partners (\u201cAdvertisers\u201d) to choose the demographic information of users who will see their advertisements and/or promotional offers and you agree that we may provide any of the information we have collected from you in non-personally identifiable form to an Advertiser, in order for that Advertiser to select the appropriate audience for those advertisements and/or offers. For example, we might use the fact you are located in San Francisco to show you ads or offers for San Francisco businesses, but we will not tell such businesses who you are. Or, we might allow Advertisers to display their ads to users with similar usage patterns to yours, but we will not disclose usage information to Advertisers except in aggregate form, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. Note that if an advertiser asks us to show an ad to a certain audience or audience segment and you respond to that ad, the advertiser may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they were trying to reach. We may deliver a file to you through the Services (known as a \u201cweb beacon\u201d) from an ad network. Web beacons allow ad networks to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us and for advertisers. Web beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites. Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network\u2019s servers, these companies can view, edit, or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site. You may be able to opt-out of web beacon tracking conducted by third parties through our Services by adjusting the Do Not Track settings on your browser; please note that we don\u2019t control whether or how these third parties comply with Do Not Track requests. Affiliated Businesses: In certain situations, businesses or third party websites we\u2019re affiliated with may sell or provide products or services to you through or in connection with the Services (either alone or jointly with us). You can recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service, and we will share your Personal Information with that affiliated business only to the extent that it is related to such transaction or service. One such service may include the ability for you to automatically transmit Third Party Account Information to your Services profile or to automatically transmit information in your Services profile to your third party account; for example, transmitting your public profile information from Facebook. We have no control over the policies and practices of third party websites or businesses as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to take part in any transaction or service relating to an affiliated website or business, please review all such business\u2019 or websites\u2019 policies. Our Agents: We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you; for example, we may use a payment processing company to receive and process your credit card transactions for us. Unless we tell you differently, our agents do not have any right to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. Note that an \u201cagent\u201d may also be considered a \u201cpartner\u201d in certain circumstances, and may be subject to the terms of the \u201cInformation that\u2019s been de-identified\u201d section above in that regard. User Profiles and Submissions: Certain user profile information, including your name, location, and any video or image content that such user has uploaded to the Services, may be displayed to other users to facilitate user interaction within the Services or address your request for our services. Your account privacy settings may allow you to limit the other users who can see the Personal Information in your user profile and/or what information in your user profile is visible to others.] Please remember that any content you upload to your public user profile, along with any Personal Information or content that you voluntarily disclose online in a manner other users can view (on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, etc.) becomes publicly available, and can be collected and used by anyone. Your user name may also be displayed to other users if and when you send messages or comments or upload images or videos through the Services and other users can contact you through messages and comments. Business Transfers: We may choose to buy or sell assets, and may share and/or transfer customer information in connection with the evaluation of and entry into such transactions. Also, if we (or our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, Personal Information could be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party. Protection of TrainingData and Others: We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that we believe is necessary to comply with law or court order; enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of TrainingData, our employees, our users, or others. Is Personal Information about me secure? Your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security. If you access your account via a third party site or service, you may have additional or different sign-on protections via that third party site or service. You must prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password and/or other sign-on mechanism appropriately and limiting access to your computer or device and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account. We endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other Personal Information we hold in our records, but unfortunately, we cannot guarantee complete security. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time.

What choices do I have? You can always opt not to disclose information to us, but keep in mind some information may be needed to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features. You may be able to add, update, or delete information as explained above. When you update information, however, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records. You may request deletion of your account by contacting us at support@TrainingData.io. Some information may remain in our records after your deletion of such information from your account. We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally.

Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy. By using or accessing the Services in any manner, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, and you hereby consent that we will collect, use, and share your information in the following ways. Remember that your use of TrainingData\u2019s Services is at all times subject to the Terms of Use, which incorporates this Privacy Policy. Any terms we use in this Policy without defining them have the definitions given to them in the Terms of Use. What does this Privacy Policy cover? This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information (\"Personal Information\") that we gather when you are accessing or using our Services, but not to the practices of companies we don\u2019t own or control, or people that we don\u2019t manage. We gather various types of Personal Information from our users, as explained in more detail below, and we use this Personal Information internally in connection with our Services, including to personalize, provide, and improve our services, to allow you to set up a user account and profile, to contact you and allow other users to contact you, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, and to analyze how you use the Services. In certain cases, we may also share some Personal Information with third parties, but only as described below. As noted in the Terms of Use, we do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any personal information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us personal information, please contact us at support@TrainingData.io Will TrainingData ever change this Privacy Policy? We\u2019re constantly trying to improve our Services, so we may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to time as well, but we will alert you to changes by placing a notice on the Services, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means. Please note that if you\u2019ve opted not to receive legal notice emails from us (or you haven\u2019t provided us with your email address), those legal notices will still govern your use of the Services, and you are still responsible for reading and understanding them. If you use the Services after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of the changes. What Information does TrainingData Collect? Information You Provide to Us: We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us. For example, through the registration process and/or through your account settings, we may collect Personal Information such as your name, email address, phone number, and third-party account credentials (for example, your log-in credentials for Facebook or other third party sites). If you provide your third-party account credentials to us or otherwise sign in to the Services through a third party site or service, you understand some content and/or information in those accounts (\u201cThird Party Account Information\u201d) may be transmitted into your account with us if you authorize such transmissions], and that Third Party Account Information transmitted to our Services is covered by this Privacy Policy; for example, your public profile information from Facebook. Certain information may be required to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features. We may communicate with you if you\u2019ve provided us the means to do so. For example, if you\u2019ve given us your email address, we may send you promotional email offers on behalf of other businesses, or email you about your use of the Services. Also, we may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. This confirmation helps us make our communications with you more interesting and improve our services. If you do not want to receive communications from us, please indicate your preference by emailing us at support@TrainingData.io. Information Collected Automatically Whenever you interact with our Services, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser or device, which may include your IP address, geolocation data, device identification, \u201ccookie\u201d information, the type of browser and/or device you\u2019re using to access our Services, and the page or feature you requested. \u201cCookies\u201d are identifiers we transfer to your browser or device that allow us to recognize your browser or device and tell us how and when pages and features in our Services are visited and by how many people. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your device\u2019s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features. Our advertising partners may also transmit cookies to your browser or device, when you click on ads that appear on the Services. Also, if you click on a link to a third party website or service, such third party may also transmit cookies to you. Again, this Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties, and we aren\u2019t responsible for their privacy policies and practices. Please be aware that cookies placed by third parties may continue to track your activities online even after you have left our Services, and those third parties may not honor \u201cDo Not Track\u201d requests you have set using your browser or device. We may use this data to customize content for you that we think you might like, based on your usage patterns. We may also use it to improve the Services - for example, this data can tell us how often users use a particular feature of the Services, and we can use that knowledge to make the Services interesting to as many users as possible. Information Collected From Other Websites and Do Not Track Policy Through cookies we place on your browser or device, we may collect information about your online activity after you leave our Services. Just like any other usage information we collect, this information allows us to improve the Services and customize your online experience, and otherwise as described in this Privacy Policy. Your browser may offer you a \u201cDo Not Track\u201d option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites. Our Services do not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means that we collect information about your online activity both while you are using the Services and after you leave our Services. Will TrainingData Share Any of the Personal Information it Receives? We may share your Personal Information with third parties as described in this below: Information that\u2019s been de-identified. We may de-identify your Personal Information so that you are not identified as an individual, and provide that information to our partners. We may also provide aggregate usage information to our partners (or allow partners to collect that information from you), who may use such information to understand how often and in what ways people use our Services, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal online experience. However, we never disclose aggregate usage or de-identified information to a partner (or allow a partner to collect such information) in a manner that would identify you as an individual. Analytics: We may use third party analytics services, such as Google Analytics, to grow our business, to improve and develop our Services, to monitor and analyze use of our Services, to aid our technical administration, to increase the functionality and user-friendliness of our Services, and to verify that users have the authorization needed for us to process their requests. These services may collect and retain some information about you. Google Analytics collects the IP address assigned to you on the date you use the Services, but not your name or other personally identifying information. We do not combine the information generated through the use of Google Analytics with your Personal Information. Although Google Analytics plants a persistent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you use the Services, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google.

These Terms are governed by and will be construed under the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the State of California, without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof. Arbitration Agreement. PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS WITH TrainingData AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US. Both you and TrainingData acknowledge and agree that for the purposes of any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms, TrainingData\u2019s officers, directors, employees and independent contractors (\u201cPersonnel\u201d) are third party beneficiaries of these Terms, and that upon your acceptance of these Terms, Personnel will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as the third party beneficiary hereof. (a) Arbitration Rules; Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. Any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms shall be finally settled by binding arbitration in San Francisco County, California. The arbitration will proceed in the English language, in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (\"JAMS\") then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes, who shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with such Rules. Judgment upon the award rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing obligation to arbitrate disputes, each party shall have the right to pursue injunctive or other equitable relief at any time, from any court of competent jurisdiction. (b) Costs of Arbitration. The JAMS rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees. TrainingData will pay all arbitration fees for claims less than $75,000. TrainingData will not seek its attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous. (c) Small Claims Court. Furthermore, either you or TrainingData may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in San Francisco County, California or any United States county where you live or work. (d) Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND TrainingData WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FORNT OF A JUDGE OR JURY. You and TrainingData are instead choosing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In any litigation between you and TrainingData over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND TrainingData WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge. (e) Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor we are entitled to arbitration; instead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in (g) below. (f) Opt-out. You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Section by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: 170 Capp Street, Suite A, SF, CA 94110 postmarked within 30 days of first accepting these Terms. You must include (1) your name and residence address; (2) the email address and/or telephone number associated with your account; and (3) a clear statement that you want to opt out of these Terms\u2019 arbitration agreement. (g) Exclusive Venue. If you send the opt-out notice in (f), and/or in any circumstances where the foregoing arbitration agreement permits either you or TrainingData to litigate any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms in court, then the foregoing arbitration agreement will not apply to either party and both you and TrainingData agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the state or federal courts located in, respectively, San Francisco County, California, or the Northern District of California. Miscellaneous. You will be responsible for paying, withholding, filing, and reporting all taxes, duties, and other governmental assessments associated with your activity in connection with the Services, provided that the TrainingData may, in its sole discretion, do any of the foregoing on your behalf or for itself as it sees fit. The failure of either you or us to exercise, in any way, any right herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated, to the minimum extent necessary, so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. You and TrainingData agree that these Terms are the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding between you and TrainingData, and that these Terms supersede and cancel all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of these Terms,. You hereby acknowledge and agree that you are not an employee, agent, partner, or joint venture of TrainingData, and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind TrainingData in any respect whatsoever. You and TrainingData agree there are no third party beneficiaries intended under these Terms.","title":"Terms of Use"},{"location":"v1.0/Terms and Conditions/Terms of Use/#terms-of-use","text":"PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR USE OF AND ACCESS TO OUR SERVICES (DEFINED BELOW) ARE SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING TERMS; IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE FOLLOWING, YOU MAY NOT USE OR ACCESS THE SERVICES IN ANY MANNER.

These Terms are governed by and will be construed under the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the State of California, without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof. Arbitration Agreement. PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS WITH TrainingData AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US. Both you and TrainingData acknowledge and agree that for the purposes of any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms, TrainingData\u2019s officers, directors, employees and independent contractors (\u201cPersonnel\u201d) are third party beneficiaries of these Terms, and that upon your acceptance of these Terms, Personnel will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as the third party beneficiary hereof. (a) Arbitration Rules; Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. Any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms shall be finally settled by binding arbitration in San Francisco County, California. The arbitration will proceed in the English language, in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (\"JAMS\") then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes, who shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with such Rules. Judgment upon the award rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing obligation to arbitrate disputes, each party shall have the right to pursue injunctive or other equitable relief at any time, from any court of competent jurisdiction. (b) Costs of Arbitration. The JAMS rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees. TrainingData will pay all arbitration fees for claims less than $75,000. TrainingData will not seek its attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous. (c) Small Claims Court. Furthermore, either you or TrainingData may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in San Francisco County, California or any United States county where you live or work. (d) Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND TrainingData WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FORNT OF A JUDGE OR JURY. You and TrainingData are instead choosing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In any litigation between you and TrainingData over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND TrainingData WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge. (e) Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor we are entitled to arbitration; instead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in (g) below. (f) Opt-out. You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Section by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: 170 Capp Street, Suite A, SF, CA 94110 postmarked within 30 days of first accepting these Terms. You must include (1) your name and residence address; (2) the email address and/or telephone number associated with your account; and (3) a clear statement that you want to opt out of these Terms\u2019 arbitration agreement. (g) Exclusive Venue. If you send the opt-out notice in (f), and/or in any circumstances where the foregoing arbitration agreement permits either you or TrainingData to litigate any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms in court, then the foregoing arbitration agreement will not apply to either party and both you and TrainingData agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the state or federal courts located in, respectively, San Francisco County, California, or the Northern District of California. Miscellaneous. You will be responsible for paying, withholding, filing, and reporting all taxes, duties, and other governmental assessments associated with your activity in connection with the Services, provided that the TrainingData may, in its sole discretion, do any of the foregoing on your behalf or for itself as it sees fit. The failure of either you or us to exercise, in any way, any right herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated, to the minimum extent necessary, so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. You and TrainingData agree that these Terms are the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding between you and TrainingData, and that these Terms supersede and cancel all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of these Terms,. You hereby acknowledge and agree that you are not an employee, agent, partner, or joint venture of TrainingData, and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind TrainingData in any respect whatsoever. You and TrainingData agree there are no third party beneficiaries intended under these Terms.","title":"Terms of Use"},{"location":"v1.0/Workspace/Active Viewport Image/","text":"Active Viewport Image (middle) Active Viewport shows the current image on which a user is creating annotations.","title":"Active Viewport Image"},{"location":"v1.0/Workspace/Active Viewport Image/#active-viewport-image-middle","text":"Active Viewport shows the current image on which a user is creating annotations.","title":"Active Viewport Image (middle)"},{"location":"v1.0/Workspace/Folder Navigation/","text":"Folder Navigation (left) TrainingData.io workspace allows you to partition your dataset into folders for easy navigation.
